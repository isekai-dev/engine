# THE MARCH TOWARDS A BRIGHTER FUTURE
## [3/22/2019] [NOPE] [BOSE HEADPHONES THOUGH]

New website http://isekai.dev should be up any time now. I'm using it as the test case for the [ISEKAI] engine. This was a huge bump in the road for goblin.life but it'll be okay.

    [THEME][ISEKAI]
Can provide a JSON file that is the same as the VS CODE generate color for your ADMIN interface/ maybe UI?.

    [ISEKAI][??][STANDALONE]
Should I provide an Isekai standalone executable? Would it just be electron? I think so?

    [ISEKAI][ADMIN]
Provide an admin interface that is the isekai CLI somehow? Anyhow, this would feed into the electron APP. Could do som eneat things like opening tables/resources in their own cyberpunk style pop ups. heh.

    [ISEKAI][BROWSER]
Need to get the browser builds working so I can do some svelte pages of the ADMIN

    [ISEKAI.DEV]
Get website up and running. I should probably just do this now w/ a bad update loop.... okay.

# THE GLORIOUS FRUITS OF REWARD
## [3/20/2019] [🎶🎧 - Infinite Happiness]

Didn't happen.

# THE GLORIOUS FRUITS OF DISAPPOINTMENT
## [3/19/2019] [🎶🎧 - Infinite Sadness]
    [ISEKAI*ENGINE][!]
CLI is working. Can npm i -g @isekai/engine and the run isekai build/etc. Nothing is running on top of it yet.

# HOLY CRAP IS THIS HARD
## [3/18/2019] [🎶🎧 - Infinite Sadness]
Been working on the [ISEKAI*ENGINE] refactor all day and I might be able to finish tomorrow?

See you then I guess?

# FEATURE FLAGS, NEW RENDERER, ZALGO
## [3/17/2019] [🎶🎧 - OF MONTREAL - POSTAL SERVICE]
Woo back on the game. Did some bonus code last night to implement a cool magic zalgo system but my other features aren't ready. Oh crap... so many options. Going with [FEATURE FLAGS].

    [FEATURE FLAGS]
Basically an object with the names for keys and an object with anything I want on them stored as a TOML file.

This way I can ship the client without the new [WEBGL] renderer but with the Zalgo text support turned on. This isn't that important for this feature as the renderer is pretty much done but I want to get it setup for future success. 

    [ZALGO][soon]
    [DIVINE][X][!]
    [WEBGL][soon]
    [ISEKAI*ENGINE]
Worked on the layout of [ISEKAI*ENGINE] and how it loads custom content/scripts.



# NEW RENDERER THE NON SYSADMIN VERSION
## [WEEKEND] [ 3/15/2019 - 3/16/2019 ] [🎶🎧 - DETHKLOK - THE UNICORNS]

Wow, I'm finally done with adventures in SysAdmin land for now. I refactored the entire server architecture. I'm getting a bonus day in here for second work day. Kinda like second breakfast but less filling.

    [STAGING]
Got a staging box setup so I can test out deployments.

    [TWITCH]
Migrated my twitch streaming setup to a dedicated box with a UPS (lol its an old laptop of mine). Less interruptions and frees up my dev box from acting like a production one.

    [WEBGL][CLIENT][soon]
PIXI renders our new 2D client. This is way faster and got this pretty far. Got the sprites renderering with clever work around creating a tileset from http://openmoji.org. I want to offer custom tileset support in the future but we'll see when that lands. I also put the matter objects on a spring rather than lerping them. This should make any latency feel way smoother. 

Man do I need better art soon.

    [DIVINE][X][soon]
Removed the Divine system (good bye spawning creatures by clicking).

    [PSA][soon]
Added text in the bottom left hand corner that updates with whatever event you witnessed was. It also shows [ZALGO] responses.

    [HINTS][soon]
Show hints in the bottom right corner, like an example [ZALGO].

    [ZALGO][soon]
Zalgo replaces the [DIVINE] interaction system. Basically ZALGO are

# NEW RENDERER
## [ 3/14/2019 ] [🎶🎧 - THE BLACKEST OF METAL - THE SOCIAL NETWORK] [261]

Welp, its time to take svelte out back so we can make room for our new renderer.

    [CRASH][FUCK]
The server went down sometime between me falling asleep and waking back up. I setup monitoring but I never charge my phone so sorry world. Wtf nodemon didn't rest.. nodemon is for development.. okay installed forever! Things check out great on development... push push.. manually restart of process... start.. . .. . CRASH.. FUCK. okay quick script change start... CANNOT BIND PORT .. fak fka fka fkafkak . . Oh http://goblin.life is working?

And that brings us to now. 
![What is Sys Admin](/memes/is_this_being_sysadmin.jpg)

Anyhow, back in the office and trying to figure out wtf is going on there while also trying to update to the new renderer which will offer consistent looks and much better perf!

    [LOG]
Added assets for the log ^ see above.

    [FOREVER][SYSADMIN][!]
Get forever worked out before everything goes to hell. Actually solved this with...

    [PM2][SYSADMIN][lol]
Okay process management 2 is a wonderful piece of software and I love it to death.

    [PM2][HTTP][FORK][lol]
Moving the HTTP servers over to their instances by sharing a port through some node fork fuckery.

    [SYSADMIN][ohno]
Okay redesigned the whole server architecture. There are now like 7 types of servers and they're super modular. They can communicate to the outside world with http and BIFROST but also internally with ASGARD. Asgard is a port they're all listening to and acts as a broadcast port. Aircraft pilots have two CB radios setup and one specifically listening to channel that acts in the same way. There is a server type called WORMHOLE that broadcasts any ASGARD message to all other repeaters which then repeat them internally on their server. If they already have seen a message they don't forward it. This ensures all asgard messages are sent across the network. 

    [ASGARD][DEFER][!]
Defer the asgard channel for another time since I'm only on one server. Rather do some other work

    [OTF][RENDERER][!]
USE A OTF FONT TO MAKE EVERYTHING CONSISTENT.

    [TWITCH]
Use twitch integration to spit out magic zalgo phrases to twitch.

    [IDENTITY][ZALGO][soon]
Offer a login with their ZALGO. This zalgo is granted power while online from events. Can only be on one zalgo at a time. Can use blib to generate nonsense phrases from teh english. Encourage streamers to share their zalgo.

    [STATUS ONLINE][soon]
Open SSE connection that feeds data: document.body updates so the page will always self updates. Use existing bifrost, new message type. :D

    [GAME SHOW][soon]
Have users identify themselves as a 64 bit code composed as a grid of buttons either light or not. 
Pick randomly off STATUS ONLINE and gift them zaptos.

    [RENDERER][INVESTIGATE]
We gotta get dat perf up. Also it'd be lovely if all platforms matched 

    [DATA][INVESTIGATE]
I'm going to compact the data over the bifrost so we're sending less. Should even further help perf and look cool on matrix.html!


# FACTIONS! AND SSE!
## [ 3/13/2019 ] [🎶🎧 - CLASSICAL ROCK COVERS]

I couldn't sleep I was so excited to implement the next parts. Fuck.

Well got that sleep at noon and made it back in time for the midnight working hour. Twitch stuff is going great, no viewers but hey every person who comes in is precious at this stage. Wrote a bunch of ideas out for later and started tagging the items better for later searching!

Working on adding a ghost that SIN lerps up your screen when there is a corpse. You see the ghosts feed the clouds until they burst with rain.

Checkout [https://goblin.life/bifrost](https://goblin.life/bifrost) if you haven't already. Its the stream of life that pumps your render-only clients full of data from the simulation servers. It's basically staring into the matrix.

    [FACTIONS][CONTENT]
Dude sweet, turtles vs everything and turtles won the first match.

    [TWITCH]
The twitch stream is up and running 24/7. I'm listening on the chat there and trying to be active. Free free to ask my any questions!

    [TWITCH][INTEGRATION][soon][CODE][CONTENT]
Had an idea to have twitch vote on weather and other "godly" events! This could be a really cool way to create interesting mayhem in the world!

    [POSSESSION][soon][DESIGN][CODE][CONTENT]
What would be even better is taking control over a creature and being able to make your mark in the world! 

    [MUSIC][soon][CODE]
I really like abundant.ly's procedural music and want to work it into the game but would need...

    [UI][soon][DESIGN]
Honestly a super easy task technically but aesthetically what do I want the UI to look like? Struggles man.

    [TWITCH][DESIGN]
Black bar on top and bottom. Logo of engine + blog/game links on top. Any current news on the bottom. I think I want to keep with this format and encourage streamers to stream the game as well!

    [WEATHER][CODE][DESIGN]
Oh yeah! Its happening.

    [CLIENT][PERFORMANCE][CODE][soon]
I want the world to be HUUUUUUGE so I need to do some client perf comparisons and maybe start chunking the universe.

    [TOPBAR]
Shameless self promotion but probably important.

    [BIFROST][MATRIX]
Noticed the bifrost looked kinda like the matrix so I've created a matrix view for it? https://goblin.life/matrix.html okay and I added it to the stream! Looks A+ in my book. Totally worth the time... :D

    [GHOSTS]
You see the ghosts feed the clouds until they burst with rain. Also they're in now.

    [FACTIONS][soon][SOON][LOL]
Three factions. One undead/monsters, one fantasy, one painfully normal. 

    [FORCE][CODE]
Can have a velocity on a matter now. 

```json
    {
        FORCE: {
            velocity: [-1, 1]
        }
    }
```
    [CLOUDS][WEATHER][CODE][DESIGN]
Clouds now spawn when enough ghosts have been collected. Didn't you know clouds are made of ghosts?

    [RAIN][WEATHER][CODE][DESIGN]
I really want to make it rain... Got some ideas for this.
WOO, nvm. Got a version of rain in that I'm happy with. I still want to revist the animation.


# The Start?
## [ 3/12/2019 ] [🎶🎧 - DAFT PUNK]

Starting a dev log so I can keep track of anything cool I did that day. I'm going to back fill the previous days as I remember them. Oh.. and I started streaming just the browser at "inastrangemood" oo Twitch.tv (Dwarf fortress joke). No sound/voice, just telling people to go to http://goblin.life which I got up and working yesterday.

Oh fuck the github webhook is broken. I think its trying to run server.js too quickly.

    [WEBHOOK][FIXED]
Exec/Spawn can be a cluster fuck. In this case I have no idea what I did to fix it actually. Well then.

    [SSE]
Use Server Sent Events instead of polling for the bifrost data. Send divine calls over /divine instead. Should increase perf and make life better?

    [NAME] 
Finally found a great name for the whole project... *drum roll* ...
[Isekai] which means literally [A Different World] but maybe actually [A Stranger in Stranger Land]. Its a whole genre of Japanese and American media for the trope of a character being transported to another realm which isn't quite like our own. I feel like this fits the theme of our project perfectly.

    [REPL] 
Got a REPL with sweet symbols "⚙>" working. Two commands so far .LAW and .MATTER

    [HAS] 
 You can inherit multiple templates using has, Order of importance is [user_data, user_data.has, is, has: [1, 2, 3]];

    [EMOJIS] 
Added support for any emoji via is. Try the { is: fish }

    [LOG] 
This secret blog! Wow, much important as... its the only reason you're reading this!
  
    [TRAIT BASED DISPLAY]
You can name a svelte file by a component and it'll only be mixed into the display if the component is present on matter. ie: INTELLIGENT.svelte matches matter.INTELLIGENT component;

    [WEATHERsoon]
Heh, today all started on a quest for weather. Maybe I'll get to it.

    [SERVER SIDE PUSHsoon]
Better than polling.


# [http://goblin.life]() is up!
## [3/11/2019] [🎶🎧 - GLORYHAMMER]

Got all the orchestration, ssl (https LetsEncrypt), and hosting (digital ocean). Took a bit to get the webhgook push working but holy crap is this way better. Also tracked down a nasty bug where the dev environment was different than production! It turns out that some laws were stored as lower case in the git. Changed that and boom fixed. Lots of wasted time debugging that one.

    [http://goblin.life]
Bought domain, updated named server, and hosted the server.

    [SSL]
https support and auto redirect http to https

    [GITHUB WEBHOOK]
This is for auto updating/deploying the server when a chagne is made on the production branch.


# MULTIPLAYER AND A BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME AND SPACE
## [EONS AGO THE PROPHECY FORETOLD] [🎶🎧 EPIC MUSIC MOSTLY]
Got multiplayer working! Woweeeee. Short blog too far in the past. Anyhow here's all the shit that happened prior to this....

    [CORE]
The Core of everything. I got really full of myself and made a sweet reality based Entity Component System. So like uh... There is [MATTER], [LAWS], and uh a [GATEWAY]. ok ok I know, I know stay with me though. [MATTER] is like the entity and components. 

 It has a couple properties like 
 ```js
 {
     is: "something",
     has: ["Something..."]
 }

 ```
eehh maybe I'll finish this seciton one day. Anyhow made the [CORE]. This one took awhile to get right!

    [CORE TESTED]
Yeah, yeah. This came later after the skeleton of the [CORE] was setup. Uses babelrc + mocha + chai and has nice vs code support so I can just hit f5 and be attached with a debugger;

    [LAWS]
What? Yeah [LAWS] are awesome. The originals were [TIME], [DATA], [SPACE].

    [CLIENT]
Woo got a svelte 3 based client up and rendering matter(); Using emojis and ascii art to great effect! Woo. Took a day.

    [CLIENT IN 3D]
Did some CSS3 magic to rotate the gameboard and give it a 3D effect. Took 15 minutes. Wow, thanks browser :D

    [MULTIPLAYER]
Woo, the [Isekai⚙Engine] is running on a server and rendering the data on the client! This took a day and was an amazing part to get up and running.
